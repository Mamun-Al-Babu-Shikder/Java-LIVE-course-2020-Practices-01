# Go wild with playing card

You have an interface Card and Deck. 
Let's say you have a game board. You can play many types of games. 

There could be several implementations of Deck, eg. French, Italian, German

Implement the deck differently,  and then add a default method in Deck.java so that its implemented
classes don't have to implement the method.
